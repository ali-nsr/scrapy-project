# scrapy-project

this repository is for getting products or anything from an api with pagination such as products, articles and anything you want.
in this project we request an api that has (title, image_link, availability, page_url, current_price, old_price, total_pages_count).
all products are wraped in a list called "products". we get all datas from this list and save them in our database.
